# Mask-Selfie-Recognition

1. The goal of our project is to try and train the best model that returns the highest accuracy in the Medical Mask Selfie Facial Recognition. 
2. For this project, data is collected through students as we required to capture 500 images of selfie with a medical mask. The selfie must be captured from front view only and using either smartphone or webcam. There are a total of 80,500 images used.
3. We are required to divide the datasets into 3 subsets with ratio 60-20-20. 
4. Model : Random Forest
5. Each file contains a random forest model with different hyperparameters.
